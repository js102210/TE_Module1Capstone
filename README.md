Vending Machine Capstone project developed in a team during Tech Elevator coding bootcamp

A command-line application emulating a Vending Machine, developed as part of coding bootcamp curriculum at Tech Elevator to explore and reinforce OOP principles. 

Application reads a source file containing inventory, and populates memory with the name of each inventory and a value of 5, representing the quantity. 
Associates each item with a price, also provided in the inventory file.

Users are able to deposit money from the console by typing the aount of money into the relevant menu option. 
If a user has enough money to purchase an item, they can purchse it from the menu, which updates the number of that item in the machine, and updates how much money the user has, in the system's memory. 

When a user leaves the purchase menu, they are automatically dispensed 'change' by printing values to the console, in the smallest number of coins possible. 

The machine also includes a hidden menu option to view a sales report, which records how many of each item were purchased in the current session to a txt file.
